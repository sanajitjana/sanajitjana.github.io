# Getting Started with Hugo

Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator built with Go. In this post, we'll explore the basics of setting up and using Hugo for your website.

## Why Choose Hugo?

Hugo offers several advantages:

- **Blazing Fast**: Written in Go, Hugo is incredibly fast at generating sites
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands and intuitive structure
- **Flexible**: Supports themes, content types, and custom layouts
- **No Dependencies**: No need for databases or complex server setups

## Basic Hugo Commands

```bash
# Create a new site
hugo new site my-site

# Add a new post
hugo new posts/my-post.md

# Start development server
hugo server -D

# Build for production
hugo --minify
```

## Content Organization

Hugo uses a simple but powerful content organization:

- `content/` - Your site's content (posts, pages)
- `themes/` - Hugo themes
- `static/` - Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
- `layouts/` - Custom layouts (if needed)
