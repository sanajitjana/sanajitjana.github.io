# Deploying Hugo Sites

Once you've built your Hugo site, the next step is deployment. Hugo makes it easy to deploy to various platforms. Let's explore some popular deployment options.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a great option for hosting Hugo sites:

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
2. **Push your Hugo source code**
3. **Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds**
4. **Configure the repository settings for Pages**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
      - run: hugo --minify
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```

## Netlify

Netlify offers excellent performance and features:

- **Automatic deployments** from Git
- **Custom domains** and HTTPS
- **Form handling** and serverless functions
- **Split testing** and rollbacks

## Other Options

- **Vercel**: Fast deployment with global CDN
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Scalable and cost-effective
- **GitLab Pages**: Similar to GitHub Pages but on GitLab

## Build Optimization

Before deploying, optimize your site:

```bash
# Minify HTML, CSS, and JS
hugo --minify

# Generate optimized images
hugo --gc --minify

# Check for broken links
hugo --printPathWarnings
```

## Performance Tips

- Use a CDN for static assets
- Enable gzip compression
- Optimize images
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use browser caching

Deploying Hugo sites is straightforward and there are many excellent hosting options available. Choose the platform that best fits your needs and workflow.
