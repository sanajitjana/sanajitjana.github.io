In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the core concepts of containerization and Docker.\nWhat is Docker? Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that can run applications and their dependencies.\nWhy Use Docker? 1. Consistency Same environment from development to production No more \u0026ldquo;works on my machine\u0026rdquo; issues 2. Isolation Applications run in their own containers Dependencies don\u0026rsquo;t conflict with each other 3.

In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the key concepts and benefits of microservices.\nWhat are Microservices? Microservices are a software development technique where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.\nKey Benefits 1. Scalability Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific needs.\n2. Technology Diversity Different services can use different technologies that best fit their requirements.\n3. Fault Isolation If one service fails, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring down the entire application.\nSpring Boot and Microservices Spring Boot makes it incredibly easy to create microservices:\nJAVA Collapse Copy @SpringBootApplication @RestController public class UserServiceApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(UserServiceApplication.class, args); } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/users\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;User\u0026gt; getUsers() { return userService.getAllUsers(); } } Click to expand and view more Communication Patterns Synchronous Communication REST APIs GraphQL Asynchronous Communication Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) Event-driven architecture Best Practices Domain-Driven Design: Design services around business domains API Gateway: Single entry point for all client requests Service Discovery: Automatic service registration and discovery Circuit Breaker: Handle service failures gracefully Challenges Distributed Systems Complexity: Debugging and monitoring become more complex Data Consistency: Managing transactions across services Service Coordination: Orchestrating multiple services Microservices offer great flexibility but require careful planning and robust infrastructure to be successful.\n","title":"Understanding Microservices Architecture"},{"link":"/posts/2025/08/hugo-theme-customization/","text":"Hugo Theme Customization The Hugo Narrow theme is highly customizable.
